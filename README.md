PHP wrapper for [Block.io](https://block.io/) for use with [Dogecoin](http://dogecoin.com/), [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/), and [Litecoin](http://litecoin.org). API key validation on instantiation, simple abstraction layer on top of existing API interfaces, and automatic JSON decoding on response.

### Requirements

This library requires the 'gmp', and cURL extensions for PHP. To enable these extensions, see:
   
   [GMP Installation Guide](http://php.net/manual/en/gmp.installation.php)

   [cURL Installation Guide](http://php.net/manual/en/curl.installation.php)

### Warning

If you're using Windows, beware that SSL will not function properly, and this library will throw errors.  

To fix the SSL issue on Windows, please do the following:

Download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem to a directory of your choice  
Make PHP use this file to validate Block.io's SSL certificate by adding this line to your php.ini:

```ini
curl.cainfo=c:\path\to\cacert.pem
```

### Usage

First, sign up for an account at [Block.io](https://block.io/) and take note of your API key under Account > Dashboard.

Download and include the block_io.php class:

```php
require_once 'path/to/block_io.php';
```

Or preferably install via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

```sh
composer require block_io-php/block_io-php
```

Instantiate the class and set your API key. If the API key is valid the set function will return true otherwise false.

```php
$apiKey = "YOUR API KEY FOR DOGECOIN, BITCOIN, OR LITECOIN";
$pin = "YOUR SECRET PIN";
$version = 2; // the API version to use

$block_io = new BlockIo($apiKey, $pin, $version);

echo "Confirmed Balance: " . $block_io->get_balance()->data->available_balance . "\n";
```

Socks5 proxy configure.

```php
$proxy = 'socks5://user:password@localhost:12345';
$apiKey = "YOUR API KEY FOR DOGECOIN, BITCOIN, OR LITECOIN";
$pin = "YOUR SECRET PIN";
$version = 2; // the API version to use

$block_io = new BlockIo($apiKey, $pin, $version, $proxy);

echo "Confirmed Balance: " . $block_io->get_balance()->data->available_balance . "\n";

```

The wrapper abstracts all methods listed at https://block.io/api/php using the same interface names. For example, to get your current account balance:

```php
$balance = $block_io->get_balance(array('label' => 'default'));
echo $balance->data->available_balance . "\n";
```

To make requests that require parameters (eg. an address label or address to withdraw to), pass through each parameter in an associative array. For example, the request below will withdraw 50 DOGE to the wallet you specify in place of `WALLET-ADDRESS-HERE`:

```php
$withdraw = $block_io->withdraw(array('amount' => '50.0', 'to_address' => 'WALLET-ADDRESS-HERE'));
```

**Note:** This library throws Exceptions when calls fail. Implement try/catch blocks, and retrieve the Exception message to see details.


Please see [Block.io PHP Docs](https://block.io/api/simple/php) for details on available calls.
